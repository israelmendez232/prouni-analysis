## Introduction
If you don't know, Prouni is the short for: *Programa Universidade para Todos* or in english as *Program University for All*. It's a federal program that provide graduate scholarships in private collages and universitys from Brazil. I decided to understand better this program as they provide data from 2005 to 2016 about several types of information as: city/state of the benefiated, course, if it's online bachelor and others. <br>

The **[source](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/mec-prouni)** of the data can be found in the site of 'Dados Abertos' from the own governament.

### Objective
This time, I want to make more deeper questions. To provide better visualizations and to generate a strong conclusion based on the data provided here.

## Process
I'm going to use this type of tools:

1. **R:** to read and treat the data, to join and understand better each part;
1. **RStudio:** use to analyse and provided with the code;
1. **RMarkdown:**  to present the result in html;
1. **ggplot2:** to create dynamic graphs.

## Conclusions
Lorem ipsum.
